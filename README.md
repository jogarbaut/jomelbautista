# Hello, I'm Jomel.

I am an aspiring tech developer.

My early career journey started in civil engineering where I dedicated years to designing, building, and retrofitting aging infrastructure to ensure safe drinking water. 

Though this experience was meaningful to me, I wanted to expand my skill set to diversify the projects and problems that teams in the tech industry have the opportunity to address. 

To gain skills in tech, I began by taking computer science courses at local colleges through their continuing education programs in the evenings. This led me to enrolling in and completing a coding boot camp to receive a Full-Stack Developer certificate. Through my learnings, I have gained tech skills in the following technology stacks:

- MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js
- Python, Flask, MySQL, AJAX
